from script1 import hello
"""
WE PUT IF __NAME__ == __MAIN__ CONDITION IN SCRIPT 1 BEFORE CALLING HELLO().
IF WE WOULD HAVE RUN SCRIPT 2 WITHOUT PUTTING CONDITION IN SCRIPT 1 THEN FIRST LINE WOULD HAVE EXECUTED EVERYTHING
WHICH WE ARE CALLING THERE IN SCRIPT 1 AND THEN CALLED HELLO METHOD IN SCRIPT 2 AGAIN.
NOW SINCE WE ARE IMPORTING SCRIPT 1 IN SCRIPT 2 SO __NAME__ VALUE WILL NOT BE __MAIN__ ANYMORE IT WII BE
'Script1's __name__ is equal to script1' THATS WHY HELLO METHOD DIDNT GET EXECUTED INSIDE SCRIPT 1 
WHEN IMPORTING SCRIPT 1 INTO SCRIPT 2.

IF WE CALL SAME FILE WHERE METHOD EXIST , THEN ONLY __NAME__ WILL BE __MAIN__.

If your script has `if __name__ == '__main__'` clause, it means: "this script can be imported OR run standalone".
